## Prerequisities
* Docker (>=1.12.1)
* Docker compose (>=1.8.0)

* type `./start-local-environment.sh` to run all dockers from `docker-compose.yml`
* type `./start-db.sh` to start database with liquibase migrations

* `docker-compose down` stops and <strong>removes</strong> containers from `docker-compose.yml`
